# nematic_-embryos
# We considered three type of model for the formation of nematic order in embryogenesis development.
# Model (i)

# The cell orientation cell, Œ∏_i (the angle between the long axis of a cell and the horizontal axis), is influenced only by the orientation of four nearest (up, down, left, and right) neighbors. The goal of Model (i) is to assess the extent of order that arises due to short range cell-cell interactions (ùíú) involving a quartet of cell.

# Model (ii)

# Cell orientation, Œ∏_i, is only influenced by a global force field. In other words, there is complete absence of cooperativity, and the dynamics is controlled by the magnitude of ‚Ñ¨.

# Model (iii)

# In the third variant, the dynamic of Œ∏_i, is influenced by both the local cell (ùíú) alignment and the global (‚Ñ¨) fields.
